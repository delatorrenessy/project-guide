This refers to the initial setup of the data required for the project's workflow. The data must first be encoded or added to the system's database, ensuring that the system can display the relevant information. This process involves populating the database with all necessary data.


1. Identify the libraries required for your project.

2. Create the schema for your library.

3. Execute the schema in your database using PhpMyAdmin.

4. Create a new PHP page and build the CRUD functionality.

5. Done!
