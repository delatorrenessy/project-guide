# Project Workflow

This refers to the sequence of tasks and transactions within the project. It must be clearly defined to easily understand how the project operates. The workflow should also outline the roles and responsibilities of each user involved in the project.

## Steps to Create a Project Workflow

1. **Define the Project’s Goal**  
   Understand the main goal of your project. What are you trying to achieve? Keep it simple and clear.

2. **List the Key Tasks**  
   Write down all the tasks that need to be completed. Break them into small, manageable steps.

3. **Arrange the Tasks in Order**  
   Organize the tasks in the order they should be done. This will show how one task leads to the next.

4. **Assign Roles**  
   Identify who will do each task. Make sure everyone knows what they’re responsible for.
